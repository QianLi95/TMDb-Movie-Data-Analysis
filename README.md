<h1> TMDb-Movie-Data-Analysis<h1>
  
<p> In this project, I will be analyzing data associated with the TMDb movie <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata">here</a. Each row corresponds to a movie and includes a range of data about each film. Relevant data to be used in the following analysis include the following variables:

   <p> revenue_adj (revenue in terms of 2010 dollars)
   </p> popularity
   </p> vote_average
   </p> runtime
   </p>  genres
   </p>  release_date

<p>In particular, I will be interested in the following questions:

   <p> What's the relationship between revenue and popularity, runtime, vote average
   </p> What kinds of properties associated with movies that have more popularity? 

<p>Throughout my analysis film revenue will be dependent variable, while popularity, runtime and vote average will be independent variables. For second question, popularity will be dependent variable, while genres, release date and runtime will be independent variables.
